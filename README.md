# üßÆ 8051-Based Visitor Counter Using IR Sensors

## üìñ Overview

This project is designed to automatically count the number of visitors entering and exiting a place (such as a room or hall) using an 8051 microcontroller. It uses two IR sensors to detect movement and a 16x2 LCD to display the current count.

## üîÑ Operation

- When a person **enters** the area, IR Sensor 1 (connected to P2.0) is triggered first, followed by IR Sensor 2 (P2.1). The system recognizes this sequence as an **entry** and increments the count.
  
- When a person **exits**, the reverse happens: IR Sensor 2 (P2.1) is triggered first, followed by IR Sensor 1 (P2.0). The system recognizes this sequence as an **exit** and decrements the count.

- The updated count is continuously displayed on the LCD.
